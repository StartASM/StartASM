comment "This is a few lines of valid StartASM code, albeit with no function"
load m<435> to r2
store r6 to m<0234>
add r1 with r2 to r2
sub r6 with r4 to r2
multiply r5 with r4 to r6
divide r8 with r8 to r1
or r4 with r2
and r1 with r2
not r6
shift left r4 by r1
shift right r2 by r4
compare r2 with r3
jump if unconditional to i[3]
jump if greater to i[8]
jump if less to i[0]
jump if equal to 'myFunc'
jump if unequal to 'myFunc'
jump if zero to i[7]
jump if nonzero to i[08]
call to 'myFunc'
push r8
pop to r6
return
stop
